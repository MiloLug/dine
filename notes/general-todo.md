# General todo

Non-defect work no stage of `notes/atl-port.md` owns: ideas, checks to run, claims nobody has
checked. Defects are in `notes/bug-tracker.md`; work a stage owns stays in that stage. Codes,
numbering and links follow `notes/bug-tracker.md`; the two files share the numbers.

- **A new find:** work no stage owns gets a code here; once a stage takes it, the entry moves into
  that stage.
- **Done:** the entry moves under `## Done`, keeps its heading, and shrinks to one line: title,
  date, commit.

## ART

### ART-19

**Port mterp, the assembly interpreter, to heap-base references.** dine-art runs the C++ switch
interpreter (`ART_USE_CXX_INTERPRETER`, `dine-art/art/build/Android.common_build.mk`), because
mterp uses references as pointers. The Linux runtime suite takes ~78 s with it, ~52 s with mterp.

### ART-20

**Trim ICU's data.** `out/ios/lib/libicudata.a` is 33 MB: ICU is built with
`--with-data-packaging=static` and no data filter (`tools/libexec/build-ios-deps.sh`).

### ART-21

**Trim the boot class path.** Release builds boot 7 jars (`kBootJars` in
`native/artbridge/artbridge.cpp`), dev builds 10 (`DevVmArgs` adds the junit jars). Each one is
opened at startup; the gain is unmeasured.

### ART-22

**A prebuilt boot image to win back startup time.** dine-art loads no boot image and no compiled
code: both hold absolute 32-bit references, while its heap references are offsets from one heap
reservation (`notes/art-findings.md` "Runs on the phone"). An image would need its references
relocated to that base (unchecked). Without an image `dine-0001-hello` takes 0.15 to 0.20 s on
Linux, against 0.03 s warm with one (`notes/art-findings.md`).

## ATL

### ATL-6

**Cut draw cost under `-Xint`, after M5d's frame-time measurement.** Candidates: the `Matrix`
allocated per `ATLCanvas.save()` (the current matrix could live in C), Canvas ops batched into one
JNI call per draw, JIT through StikDebug where the phone has it ([DINE-6](#dine-6)).

### ATL-7

**Apps that are keyboards:** `InputMethodService` over the Wayland input-method protocol, gtk-only.
After M9, if ever.

### ATL-18

**Priority: a CTFont cache on iOS, before the rest of M5d.** Every `gfx_text_*` call, every
replayed text op and every label font builds its CTFont with `cg_font`
(`dine-atl/src/backends/gfx/coregraphics/text.c`), next to a CFString, an attributed string and a
CTLine. A cache per size, family and style, shared by every thread (text calls take any thread),
keeps the fonts. A timed `measureText` loop on the phone gives the Android thread's cost before and
after.

### ATL-19

**The system serif design on iOS.** Serif text is Times New Roman: CoreText has no public call
for the system font's serif design (New York), which UIKit reaches through
`UIFontDescriptorSystemDesignSerif`. uikit could hand `cg_font` the serif font it builds.

### ATL-20

**Roboto on iOS, for Android's text widths.** SF is wider than Roboto and its lines taller (M5c's
metric table in `notes/atl-port.md`), so a layout sized in dp around Roboto text can wrap or cut a
word. Roboto (Apache 2.0) as the default sans of TextViews and Paint would match Android, at the
cost of the font files in the app and of iOS's own look.

### ATL-21

**TextKeyListener for text fields.** A text EditText has no key listener: `getKeyListener()` is
null, where AOSP returns a TextKeyListener, so app code that reads it (editability, its
capitalization) finds none.

### ATL-22

**Check CoreText off UIKit's thread.** gfx measures and lays out text with CoreText on the Android
thread and on workers, on Apple's word that its objects are thread-safe; no run has stressed it
on iOS 27.

## DINE

### DINE-6

**Try JIT through StikDebug on the dev phone (iPhone 13, iOS 27.0.1).** Sideloaded, dev-signed
apps can get JIT through StikDebug from iOS 17.4; iOS 26.4 broke it for some users
(`notes/meta.md` "iOS constraints").

### DINE-7

**Navigation checks on the phone:**
- a vertical scroll in the middle of the screen never fires Home, and a swipe from the top-left
  corner opens Notification Center, not Home (`notes/nav-gestures.md` "By hand on the phone");
- the safe-area values Dine sends on the iPhone;
- the iOS 26+ full-content pop gesture.

The settings check waits for M8c; the excluded-span check is M4a's "Open:" in `notes/atl-port.md`.

### DINE-8

**A navigation settings screen bound to the `NavigationSettings` model.** M8c builds the store,
the model and the agent command, not a screen (`notes/nav-gestures.md` "Settings").

### DINE-9

**The AtlView dev screen's run states:** while an app runs, its button brings it to the front and
the other run buttons are disabled with the footer "ATL runs once per process: relaunch Dine";
after the app exits every run button is disabled (`notes/nav-gestures.md` "Behaviour", one run per
process). M8a builds the same states on the launcher's tiles only.

### DINE-10

**Licensing checks for a packaged app** (`notes/licensing-future.md`):
- ATL's `uikit` backend, for private APIs;
- whether the backends written for Dine (`uikit`, `cfrunloop`, `embedded`, `headless`, `cli`,
  `poll`, `record`, `records`) carry code moved from ATL files;
- the last ~14k characters of the App Store Review Guidelines page, which shows no update date;
- a private-API scan of the linked binary beyond the grep and the required-reason symbols;
- how many of the 505 dine-atl Java files without an AOSP header are AOSP copies with the headers
  stripped; those would be Apache 2.0 and shrink a rewrite;
- uploading without a Mac, and the Xcode license (`notes/meta.md`).

## TOOL

### TOOL-4

**`tools/dine dbg ui type` can't press return.** The agent inserts text with `insertText:`, and a
UITextField takes an inserted newline as a space (`notes/dev-reference.md` "Debug agent").

### TOOL-5

**gtk `ui back` reports only whether ATL's main loop was up,** not what Back did: it is
`atl_nav_back`'s result.

### TOOL-6

**An ATL test hook `ATL_SCREENSHOT=<file>` that saves a window to PNG after its first frame,** and
optionally its GTK render node as text: a diffable golden of what gsk draws, like the headless
display-list golden. Its timing is exact, and it needs no compositor screenshot (`grim` on the
hidden sway does that part today), but GTK still needs a display. `gtk4-rendernode-tool render`
(installed with gtk4) turns a saved render node into a PNG. ATL already renders GTK
drawings to images (`dine-atl/src/api-impl-jni/graphics/android_graphics_Bitmap.c`) and saves PNGs
(`gdk_texture_save_to_png` in `android_app_WallpaperManager.c`); the gtk test hooks have a
window-ready point (`src/main-executable/main.c`, `src/backends/ui/gtk/dump.c`).

### TOOL-7

**Runtime-suite tests that fail for want of a tool:** `952-invoke-custom` and
`979-const-method-handle` need ASM 6, `701-easy-div-rem` has a Python 2 generator, `130-hprof`
needs `hprof-conv`, `141-class-unload` and `150-loadlibrary` need upstream's native test lib
`libarttest` (which 100 skipped tests need too). `071-dexfile-map-clean`, `677-fsi` and
`707-checker-invalid-profile` need dex2oat, which dine-art never runs: they stay expected
failures. Reasons per test: `dine-art/tests/runtime/expectations/linux-x86_64.json`.
